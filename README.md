# GDPS-cron
A CRON script for Geometry Dash Private Servers (those running on <a href="https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer">CVolton's GMDprivateServer</a>)
# What is this?
This is a script that fixes your server's creator points and other weird stuff.
# How do I set it up?
* Get python, preferably 3.9 to 3.10;
* Edit config.py (else you wouldn't be applying the cron to your server!)
* `python cron.py` and leave it turned on (I suggest using free hosting like <a href="https://pythonanywhere.com">PythonAnywhere</a>)
# Do you update this?
